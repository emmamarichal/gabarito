<p><strong>Gabarito</strong> is a light-hearted geometric sans typeface with 6 weights ranging from Regular to Black originally designed for an online learning platform in Brazil. </p>

<p>Named after the Brazilian Portuguese work for an answer sheet, Gabarito was made to help young people learn and overcome the university entry exams known as &ldquo;vestibular&rdquo;, and it did that by packing lots of high-school level symbols and figures into a very friendly voice that was equal parts functional and engaging.</p>
